##  Project Overview

This project is my first solo data analytics initiative, built entirely from scratch using personal financial data. The goal was to analyze and visualize monthly expenses across various accounts — including bank and credit card transactions — using Excel.

I applied core data analytics skills such as:
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Chart and dashboard design
- Trend analysis and forecasting

The final product is an **interactive Excel dashboard** that provides actionable insights, identifies overspending, and helps forecast future financial trends. This project demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into a practical tool for real-world decision-making.
